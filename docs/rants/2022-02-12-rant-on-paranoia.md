# Rant on paranoia
Now, this `doug-os` git repo has turned into more of a personal blog about weird subjects, but that's OK. I've had the idea of "I should build my own OS" before, and may have written about it somewhere, but it's probably now lost, so it's better that I'm now putting it on my github so there's a lower chance of it getting lost in the future. (now here comes the paranoia bit) But how "secure" is github? I sort of treat it like this "universal" place where I can back up code to, and it will always be here if my house ever burns down. Well, I suppose I ought to finally set up my own "backup machine" where I can duplicate important data. But how "secure" is that? I know next to nothing about linux, only really have experience with Ubuntu and looking stuff up on askubuntu or the wiki. Heck, I don't even really understand bash shell syntax! There's no shortage of zero-day bugs, or accidental misconfigurations that could let a malicious actor gain access to my machine and break it.

Now, I'm no stranger to paranoia. I still deal with it every day. Some weeks, it gets really bad, but it usually gets better after a while. But it's always there, has been, and will be. It's in my nature. And I've always used it as a tool to try and better myself. Well, better my technical skills, I don't think there's any hope for my social and people skills. Paranoia challenges me to keep thinking about problems, even after I've encountered a solution that is "good enough". It's sort of like OCD, the paranoia doesn't go away, so I cope with the anxiety by just continually studying and thinking about the problem. There isn't a "perfect solution" I'm striving for, since my paranoia is by its very nature irrational; there's already a "good enough" solution, and yet I'm still thinking about a problem and other solutions to it. It's very similar to "insanity", but I've found that programming and building things can be comforting; you limit the problem to a certain "approachable" scope, and create a solution. I get satisfaction from completing that solution, but then I go right back to attacking the problem by changing the scope and working on a new solution. It's a sort of "repetitive behavior" that I find comforting. And in a way, its productive, because I get better and better at building solutions, thinking about problems, etc. I guess I'm fortunate that it isn't a desctructive behavior, but I've had my fair share of destructive habits in the past, and I still struggle with anxiety and paranoia in my day to day life.

I'm reminded of [TempleOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TempleOS). I see a lot of myself in Terry, in some ways. Creating structure, building things, solving a problem within a limited scope, can all be great coping mechanisms when your mental health is poor. Modern medicine doesn't know that much about mental health, but from my own observations, I feel like my brain moves between certain "states", where paranoia is worse or better than normal. I can never really know which state I am in any given time, but I can try to reflect on recent events in the past, and try and estimate where I was, and where I might be in the future. For example, looking at my contribution activity on my github profile, I can see how I have this pattern of sometimes making a lot of commits, and then not making any for a period of time. Now that isn't the entire story, sometimes I'm doing things that aren't reflected on git, but I could definitely tell I felt "different" this past week, compared to the previous. I could tell something in my head was "shifting", even the previous week, and it sort of peaked, and for the last week, I sort of "stagnated". But now I'm writing this, and I can feel my brain "shifting states" again.

It's so easy to try and analyze this "instability" with my mental state from the perspective of a computer bug; there's a black box, and I'm trying to gleam insights into what inputs cause certain outputs, so I can better control it, be more productive, be happier, etc. But it's a fool's errand, trying to debug a live production machine, and *running the debugger on said machine*. It's so tempting to attribute subtle changes, that I am not even certain are "real state changes", to small things like "oh, it's this substance I used, or this medicine I'm on, or I bumped my head too hard yesterday". I think this is the "source" of my depression and feelings of hopelessness; because, from a certain perspective, solving this "problem" with my head is "hopeless". But all I can keep doing is trying to cope; limiting the scope of the problem to something small, and trying to at least *fix that*. Along the way, I gain skills, and maybe someday I can gain enough wisdom that I can build something that can help a lot of people. If I can't ever truly make my self happy, the least I can do is try to make others happy.

End of rant.
