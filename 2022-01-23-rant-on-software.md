# Rant on software
I am not a happy camper right now. I was trying to share a URL with a friend on my Android phone, and the springboard- the homescreen- the desktop- with all the app icons- was completely unresponsive. I had the URL copied on my clipboard, but I couldn't launch the messaging app. I ended up just hard shutting off my phone and will boot it up again tomorrow morning when I wake up. Also today, I tried to rename the profile name of my Xbox account tied to my Microsoft Account, and the form on their website bugged out, and now it says the profile name is already taken when I try again. Also today, I connected my Xbox Bluetooth Headset to my PC to join a video call, and TWO devices show up in the Windows Sound Settings window with "Xbox" in their name, and there are a total of 3 or 4 different settings windows (both legacy control panel and Win Settings App) where I can "select" or "change" which output device is considered "default" (only by certain programs, probably depending on if they are win32 or UWP or something).

I have lost all faith in modern software. If there's a tech company building something, they hire fresh undergrads with Comp Sci degrees, and there's a good chance a majority of those people have no actualy clue what they're doing. Imposter syndrome is especially real in technical professions, and most computer geeks are even more vulnerable to anxiety and other neurodivergences that can exacerbate communication issues. Upper management only knows how to hire people and dump problems on them, and only want to hear "Yes, I fixed it". There are still people out there who know how to write working software. I (hope) think I can write working software, even if I'm a little out of practice, but from my time an Uni, there's a LOT of people just flying by the seat of their pants, just hoping to not fail, get hired, and make money. But eventually, you reach a critical point, where everything starts breaking all around you, and nothing works any more. The fact that Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and other big tech companies are putting out garbage like this is really quite scary to me.

To focus on this repo a little bit, this isn't so much as an "operating system" as it is a "shell" or "user interface environment". Linux Kernel and Windows Kernel already exist, and are stable (to an extent, as long as those illiterate undergrads don't touch them), no need to reinvent the wheel, plus, it would literally take an ARMY to build a modern kernel from scratch, just considering the driver and hardware support alone, and the amount of optimizations and collaboration with hardware vendors to make everything play nice. No, I do not want to make a kernel. I just want a system that I can drop onto any machine, running Android, Linux, Windows, MacOSX, whatever, and have my own WORKING, NON BUGGY, apps, that I don't have to worry about them containing adware because I compiled them all myself. That's what Doug OS is all about, really. I just want things to "work" again, like they seemed to back when I was a kid, gosh dang it!

End of rant.
